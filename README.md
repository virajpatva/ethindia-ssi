## Project Overview

This project aims to leverage various protocols to enhance the issuance, verification, and management of Verifiable Credentials (VCs) on the Polygon blockchain. The integration of different protocols, including Polygon ID, Account Abstraction, Chainlink Functions, and The Graph, creates a robust and privacy-focused ecosystem for users to interact with VCs seamlessly.

## Protocols Used

### 1. Polygon ID

- **Functionality:**

  - **Issuer UI:** Utilize Polygon ID to issue Verifiable Credentials (VCs). The issuer UI is responsible for initiating the VC issuance process.
  - **Verifier SDK:** Implement the Verifier SDK to verify VCs, ensuring their authenticity and validity.
  - **Polygon Wallet:** Enable users to securely hold their VCs in a Polygon wallet.

- **Privacy Features:**

  - Multiple VCs: Issue multiple VCs for a user.
  - Privacy Protection: Users retain control over their data, ensuring that neither the issuer nor the verifier has access to sensitive information.

- **Advanced Usage:**
  - Proofs Integration: Utilize proofs from multiple VCs to issue another VC, enabling complex and layered credentials.

### 2. Account Abstraction

- **Account Abstraction Factory:**

  - Integrate the Account Abstraction Factory from the provided source link.
  - Enhance user wallet security using WebAuthn, eliminating the need for password management and providing a seamless login experience.

- **User Accessibility:**
  - Blockchain Legos Elimination: Users can access the world of VCs and blockchain without dealing with intricate blockchain components.

### 3. Chainlink Functions

- **Web2 to Web3 Integration:**

  - Leverage Chainlink functions to bridge data from the Web2 world to the Web3 blockchain.
  - Settle payments using Web2 data after VC issuance.

- **Real-world Integration:**
  - Connect VCs with real-world data, enhancing the utility and relevance of credentials.

### 4. The Graph

- **Event Logging:**

  - Utilize The Graph to log events related to user VCs.
  - Track verification requests with specific reasons using The Graph's event tracking capabilities.

- **Transparency and Traceability:**
  - Provide transparency by logging all relevant events on The Graph.
  - Enable traceability for every VC-related action, fostering accountability.
