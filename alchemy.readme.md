# Mumbai Testnet RPC URL Retrieval Guide

This guide provides step-by-step instructions on how to obtain the RPC URL for the Mumbai Testnet from Alchemy, a popular blockchain infrastructure provider.

## Prerequisites

1. **Alchemy Account**: Ensure that you have an active account on Alchemy. If not, sign up at [Alchemy](https://www.alchemy.com/) and log in.

2. **Project on Alchemy**: Create a new project on Alchemy or use an existing one. Each project on Alchemy corresponds to a unique set of API keys.

## Steps to Retrieve Mumbai Testnet RPC URL

### Step 1: Log in to Alchemy

Visit the [Alchemy website](https://www.alchemy.com/) and log in to your account.

### Step 2: Select or Create a Project

1. From the Alchemy Dashboard, select the project for which you want to obtain the Mumbai Testnet RPC URL.

2. If you don't have a project yet, create one by clicking on the "Create Project" button.

### Step 3: Navigate to the Dashboard

After selecting or creating a project, you will be directed to the project's dashboard.

### Step 4: Find Your Mumbai Testnet API Key

1. Look for the "API Key" section on the dashboard. Alchemy provides different API keys for each network.

2. Under the Mumbai Testnet section, you will find your unique API Key labeled as "MUMBAI."

### Step 5: Form the Mumbai Testnet RPC URL

Compose the Mumbai Testnet RPC URL using the obtained API Key:

```plaintext
https://rpc-mumbai.alchemyapi.io/v2/YOUR_MUMBAI_API_KEY
```

Replace `YOUR_MUMBAI_API_KEY` with the API Key you obtained from the Alchemy dashboard.

### Step 6: Test the RPC URL

To ensure that the RPC URL is functioning correctly, you can use it in your Ethereum development environment or tools that support custom RPC configurations.

Congratulations! You have successfully retrieved the Mumbai Testnet RPC URL from Alchemy.

## Additional Notes

- Keep your API keys secure. Do not share them publicly.
- Ensure that your Alchemy project is funded to cover potential usage costs on the Mumbai Testnet.
- If you encounter issues or have questions, refer to the Alchemy documentation or contact Alchemy support.
